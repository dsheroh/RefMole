- Fix 'Cite this' links at bottom of /detail page
  - APS and IEEE styles return "read timeout" from citeproc
  - Harvard returns empty citations

- Add support for "ftyp" parameter to select template type and provide
  special handling for javascript requests
  - Only used value appears to be ftyp=js and it returns as text/plain, so
    this seems likely to be a hacky form of AJAX handling

- Implement result set sorting

- Improve CSS

- Test /detail for a wider range of publications to ensure that all sections
  work properly

- Get proper LU favicon to replace default Dancer icon

- Add support for new search types/features per Jorgen's emailed documents

- Add CSL bypass for 'std' citation style

- Add support for unlimited result set sizes if needed (currently capped at
  250 results)

- Enable author preference options (citation style, sort direction, hidden
  publications list) after they've been added to our ORMS db

- Verify that hidden list works correctly

- Convert ORMS-based code for reading author preferences to use Catmandu::Store
  instead

- Clean up the leading ; in generated URLs

- Remove Dancer dependencies from non-Web modules

- RefMole::CiteList module is a bit of a god class.  Break it up into sensible
  groups of related functions.

- Add distinction between local and non-local users in /detail route?

- Clean cruft out of template files

- Tests for non-Web module functionality
